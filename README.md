# Golf
Collection and analysis of PGA Tour data. Python. Likely to utilize R or Julia for computation later.

# Process
~~1. Download the results webpages for every year of all PGA Tour Tournaments~~

~~2. Parse webpages into data by golfer~~

~~3. Collect list of courses~~

~~4. Get geolocation data of all courses in list~~

~~5. Split golfer data by round~~

~~6. Link geolocation data with golfer round data~~

7. IP Get weather conditions of every course on tournament days, write csv

~~8. Link weather conditions to each existing round (rewrite to before split by round?)~~

9. Get course length, rating, slope for every course

~~10. Create list of data where each element is a list of data~~

11. IP Find which weather elements strongly correlate and consider removing

12. Perform analysis

# Additional TODOs

Change printed CSVs to not have index columns, but this is low priority
